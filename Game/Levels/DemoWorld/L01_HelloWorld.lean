Title "Exploring the identity and communativity"

Introduction "We are going to begin by looking at the usage of two of our exams to expand them
! The two axioms are add_zero: ∀ a :  F, a + 0 = a and add_comm : ∀ a b :  F , a + b = b + a.
Using these two axioms we want to expand upon add_zero to be in a more complete. What i mean by this
is that ater this level we will not only be able to say that a+0=a, but that 0+a =a."

variable {F : Type*} [MyField F]

Statement (x : F): x + 0 = 0 + x := by
  rw [MyField.add_comm x 0]   -- rewrites goal to x + 0 = x

Conclusion "Congrtatulations! You have completed your first level
and can now use the theorem zero_add, you shall see it in theorems on the
next level."
