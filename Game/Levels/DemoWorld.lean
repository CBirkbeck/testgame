Title "Demo World"

Introduction "
To begin exploring Fields, we must start with what they are! A field is a set
F together with two binary operations,+: F ⨯ F → F and ∘: F ⨯ F → F such that our Field axioms hold.
To begin with, we will simply state our axioms, but throughout this world we will explore them more,
so do not worry if they apear daunting.
Informaly, we can view Fields as a set which we can perform adition and multiplication on, with
inverses. But this will be formaly defined too!
